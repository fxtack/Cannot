Routine Description:

    This routine is a pre-operation dispatch routine for this miniFilter.

    This is non-pageable because it could be called on the paging path

Arguments:

    Data - Pointer to the filter callbackData that is passed to us.

    FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
        opaque handles to this filter, instance, its associated volume and
        file object.

    CompletionContext - The context for the completion routine for this
        operation.

Return Value:

    The return value is the status of the operation.

Routine Description:

    This routine is the post-operation completion routine for this
    miniFilter.

    This is non-pageable because it may be called at DPC level.

Arguments:

    Data - Pointer to the filter callbackData that is passed to us.

    FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
        opaque handles to this filter, instance, its associated volume and
        file object.

    CompletionContext - The completion context set in the pre-operation routine.

    Flags - Denotes whether the completion is successful or is being drained.

Return Value:

    The return value is the status of the operation.
